Aggregations
----------------
Aggregations allow you to perform analysis and insights on your indexed data. They are used to group, filter and compute statistics on your data.
NOTE - We can do aggregation on keyword like integer,float,long etc and not on text
Example :  Find distribution by genre. Find avg rating of movies released in 2010
Three types of aggregations.
--------------------------------
1. Metric aggrregation.
--------------------------------
They provide insights into numerical values within a document.
GET /movies/_search
{
	"size" : 0,
	"query" : {
		"match_all" : {}
	},
	"aggs" : {
		"<custom_name_of_aggregation>" : {
			"avg" : {
				"field" : "lengthOfMovie"
			}
		}
	}
}
This will give avg length of movie in , we put size 0 so that in result we don't get all the documents. We can use comma separated aggregations
..
"aggs" : {
		"<custom_name_of_aggregation>" : {
			"avg" : {
				"field" : "lengthOfMovie"
			}
		},
		"<custom_name_of_aggregation>" : {
			"sum" : {
				"field" : "lengthOfMovie"
			}
		}
	}
	
Similary we have min, max, cardinality (distinct) (read about precision threshold), value_count, stats
--------------------------------
1. Bucket aggrregation.
--------------------------------
Bucket aggregations organize documents into "buckets" or groups based on certain criteria. These criteria can be fields, ranges, date intervals, etc. They help you understand
the distribution of data within various categories. Bucket aggregations as opposed to matric aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be aggregated
for the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation
