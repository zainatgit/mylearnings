Process vs Threads
-------------------
Process is an instance of a program getting executed. It has its own resources like memory, thread etc that OS allocates when process is created.
Process are independent of each other,never share resources
One process can have multiple threads. Threads are known as lightweight process, they are the smallest sequence of instructions that are executed by CPU independently.
When a process is created, it starts with one thread initially knows as main thread and from that we can create multiple threads to perform task concurrently.
When you run two java programs, two separate JVM instance are created. But total JVM heap memory is fixed and the two share from it.
java -Xms256m -Xmx2g Program1 --- Xms sets initial heap memory while Xmx sets max heap memory for process1
